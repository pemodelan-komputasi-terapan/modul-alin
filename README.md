# Linear Algebra

**Linear Algebra - Aljabar Linear** | The Linear Algebra course is designed so that students can solve systems of linear equations using various methods, students are able to solve matrix, vector space, basis and eigen operation problems - Mata kuliah Aljabar Linier dirancang agar mahasiswa dapat menyelesaikan masalah sistem persamaan linier dengan berbagai metode, mahasiswa mampu menyelesaikan masalah operasi matriks, ruang vektor, basis dan eigen.
<br>

**Mandatory prerequisites** - 

**Content**
1. Introduction to systems of linear equations (SPL) problems
2. SPL can be solved using Gauss elimination, Gauss Jordan, Cramer.
3. Search for determinants using elementary row operations and cofactors.
4. Inverse search using elementary row operations and cofactors.
5. In vector space problems, we will look for plane equations, parametric equations, symmetric equations, dot products, cross products and linear transformations.
6. Basis material includes spanning, linear independence, homogeneous linear equations, old basis and new basis, general solution, row space basis, column space basis, orthonormal basis, Schmidt gram.
7. Eigen problems, which will be searched for are eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonalization, orthogonal diagonalization
